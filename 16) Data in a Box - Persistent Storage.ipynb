Thus a huge amount of effort in computer systems has been devoted to making the best trade-offs between storing data on disk and RAM.

Web browsers, smartphones and other applications use SQLite as an embedded database. You begin with connect() to the local SQLite database file that you want to use or create. The special string ':memory:' creates the database in memory only. Let us make a database called business.db and the table cafe to manage our cafe business. The table columns shall be: item - a variable length string and our primary key, sales - an integer count of the number of sales of that item, and price, the price of that item."
