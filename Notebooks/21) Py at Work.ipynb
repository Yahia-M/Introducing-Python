    "Businesses have a particular fondness for data, sadly many of them conjure perverse ways of making data harder to use. Excessive data programs are not caused by the size of data on single dekstops; rather, they are the result of the aggregate of data pouring into the business. Relational databases handle millions of rows without exploding, but only so many writes ot updates at a time. A plain text or binary file can grow by gigabytes in size, but if you need to process it all at once, you need enough memory. Traditional dekstop software is not designed for this."
