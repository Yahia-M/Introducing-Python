The dynamic languages Perl, PHP and Ruby have been especially popular. The web is a client-server system. The client makes a request to a server: it opens a TCP/IP connection, sends the URL and other information via HTTP and receives a response. The format of the response is also defined by HTTP.

You will see features such as routing (URL to server function), templates (HTML with dynamic inclusions), debugging and more.

Instead of publishing web pages, you can provide data though a web application programming interface (API). Clients access your service by making requests to URLs and getting back responses containing status and data. Instead of HTML pages, the data is in formats that are easier for programs to consume, such as JSON or XML. Sometimes you might want a little bit of information, but what you need is available only in HTML pages, surrounded by extraneous content.
