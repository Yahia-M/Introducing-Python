By activating a virtual environment, you put its bin directory ahead of the usual directories in your PATH.

These annotations are fairly small, like declaring the types of some variables. For scientific-style loops of numeric calculations, adding these hints will make them much faster. Many parts of Python and its standard library are written in C for speed and wrapped in Python for convenience. If you know C and Python and really want to make code fast, writing a C extension is had, but the improvements can be worth the trouble. The standard Python implementation is written in C, and often called CPython (not to be confused with Cython). \n",

PyPy is a new Python interpreter that applies some of the tricks that sped up Java. Its benchmarks show that PyPy is faster that CPython in every test - more than six times faster on average. You can download it and use it instead of CPython. PyPy is constantly being improved, and it might even replace CPython some day.\n",
