In these languages it is good practice to use consistent indentation to make your code more readable for yourself and others.

    "Here we used == to test for equality. Python's compaison operators are: equality (==), inequality (!=), less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal (<=) and greater than or equal (>=). If you need to make multiple comparisons at the same time you use the logical operators, $\\textit{and}$, $\\textit{or}$ and $\\textit{not}$. Logical operators have lower precedence than the code that they are comparing. This means that sections of code will be calculated and then compared. Suppose we want to check whether a letter is a vowel. This requires checking against 5 possibilities which would make our if statement long. Instead, we can use the membership operator, in, to check:"
