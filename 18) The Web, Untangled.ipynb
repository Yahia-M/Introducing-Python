The dynamic languages Perl, PHP and Ruby have been especially popular. The web is a client-server system. The client makes a request to a server: it opens a TCP/IP connection, sends the URL and other information via HTTP and receives a response. The format of the response is also defined by HTTP. It includes the status of the request and the response's data and format."
